Amdahl's Law
- t_exec = 1 - f + f/P
    - f = portion of speedupable code
    - P = # of processors

Technology Trends
- DRAM capacity: 25-40%/year (slowing)
    - 8 Gb (2014), 16Gb (2019), possibly no 32 Gb
- Flash capacity: 50-60%/year
    - 8-10X cheaper/bit than DRAM
- Magnetic disk capacity: recently slowed to 5%/year
    - Density increases no longer possible
    - 8-10X cheaper/bit than flash
    - 200-300X cheaper/bit than DRAM
-Emerging NVRAM (non-volitile RAM) tech
    - PCM, STTRAM, Memristors

Cannot increase clock frequency so more parallelism!
