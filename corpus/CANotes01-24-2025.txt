CANotes 01-24-2025: 
Moore's Law -- you get transistor scaling
- Reduced latencies
- Gives us transistors to innovate

Ending of Dennard Scaling...
- Cannot clock faster
- # of transistors used for innovating is slowing

Michael Flynn's Taxonomy
1. SISD: Single Instruction- Single Data (Classic comporg processor)
    - Single program counter
2. MIMD: Multiple Instruction- Mutiple Data (multiprocessor, data center model)
    - Multiple program counters
    - Coarse grained parallelism
    - Each processor module has its own memory module with programming and data
    - Good at a wide range of things, but not best
3. SIMD: Single Instruction- Mutiple Data (GPU, tensor processors)
    - Fine grained parallelism
        - Front end processor has PC and fetches intructions from memory
        - Multiple ALU's execute same fetched intruction with their own registers
    - Does a small amount of things very well, but not multi-purpose
4. MISD: Mutiple Instruction- Single Data (Systolic arrays)
    - Systolic array
        - Important for machine learning
        - 2 dimensional connection of ALU's with one register each

History:
- SIMD  
    - CRAY Supercomputer
        - Vector processor
        - FORTRAN then later on C languages
        - Expensive
        - Hard to program
    - Connection Machine (CM)
        - C* and *LISP languages
- MIMD
    - Network of workstations
    - Data centers (racks of PC's)
    - Hi Johnseph...
- SIMD (again) 
    - Machine learning
- SISD
