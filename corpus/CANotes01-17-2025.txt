- Moore's Law
    - Gordon Moore
        - Worked at Intel
    - The number of components that can be fabricated in chip is 
    doubling per year (Now 18 months)

- Moore's law Secret Sauce... Dennard Scaling
    - Transistor dimensions could be scaled by 30% (x.7) every 
    technology generation, thus reducing their area by 50%
    - Reduce circuit delays by 30% (x.7)
    - Increase frequency by ~40% (x1.4)
    - Voltage is reduced by 30%, reducing energy by 65% and  
    power by 50%
    - Power = CV^2f
    - Transistor density doubles, the circuit becomes 40% faster, 
    and power consumption stays the same

- Virtuous Cycle
    Transistor scaling <---------
        --> Better performance  |
            --> Market growth   |
                --> Investment --
