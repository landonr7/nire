Word Count in Python (cont.)
- Read target file into an RDD: lines = sc.textFile(sis.argv[1])
    - lines is RDD with each entry being each line of the txt file
    - transformation operation
- Side note: map is a 1-to-1 mapping while flatMap is 1-to-many mapping
    - map returns one element, flatMap returns list
- Split the lines into single tokens:
words = lines.flatMap(lambda l: l.split(" "))
    - words is RDD with each entry being one word split by a space 
- Next, replace each word with a tuple of that word and number 1:
pairs = words.map(lambda w: (w, 1))
    - pairs is a new RDD where each entry is a key, value pair
- Now, for count of each word, group elements of RDD by key and add up 
values: counts = pairs.reduceByKey(lambda n1, n2: n1 + n2)
    - counts is an RDD that contains key that is each distinct word and
    value is the count of is cooresponding word
    - transformation operation
- lastly, store results in a txt file: I didnt see the code for that
