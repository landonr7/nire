Market-Basket Model
- Large set of items
- Large set of baskets
- Discover association rules
    - People who bought {x, y, z} tend to buy {v, w}

More Generally
- Many-to-many mapping between two kinds of things
    - Connections among item not baskets
- Items and baskets are abstract
    - Items/baskets can be words/documents

Applications
- Baskets = sentences; items = documents in which those sentences appear
    - Basket is a subset of documents in whcih a certain sentence appears
    - Items that appear together too often could represent plagiarism
    - Notice items do not have to be "in" baskets
    
Outline
- First: Define 
- Frequent itemsets
    - Find sets of items that appear together "frequently" in baskets 
    - Support
        - For itemset I: Number of baskets containing all items in I
        - Given support threshold s, then sets of items that appear in are 
        least s baskets are called frequent itemsets
    
- Association Rules:
    - Confidence, support, interestingness
    - Support of association rule is the support of I U J
    - Confidence of association rule is the probability of j given I
        - con(I -> j) = sup(I U j) / sup(I)
    - Interesting
        - The rule X → milk may have high confidence for many itemsets X, because
        milk is just purchased very often (independent of X) and the confidence will
        be high
        - Interest of association rule I -> j:
            - Difference between its confiednce and the fraction of baskets that contain J
            - int(I -> j) = |con(I -> j) - sup(j)|
    - Problem: Find all association rules with support >= s and confidence >= c
        - Hard part: Finding frequent itemsets

- Mining Association Rules:
    - Step 1: Find all frequent itemsets I and compute supports
    (we will explain this next)
    - Step 2: Rule generation
        - For every I, for every subset A of I, generate a rule A -> I \ A

- Finding Frequent Itemsets
    - Typically, data is kept in flat files
    rather than in a database system:
        - Stored on disk
        - Stored basket-by-basket
        - Baskets are small but we have
        many baskets and many items
        - Expand baskets into pairs, triples, etc.
        as you read baskets
        - Use k nested loops to generate all
        sets of size k
        - The true cost of mining disk-resident data
        is usually the number of disk I/Os
        - In practice, association-rule algorithms
        read the data in passes – all baskets read
        in turn
        - We measure the cost by the number of
        passes an algorithm makes over the data
