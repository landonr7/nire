Memory Hierarchy
- Objective: give illusion that we have infinite, fast, and "flat" memory that is cheap
- Cache gives us that illusion!!!

- Stages of memory
    - Microprocessor
        - Data memory (register file)
        - High speed, but high cost
        - Speed = 1
        - Cost = 10,000
        - 1 Ghz
    - CACHE!! (secret sauce)
        - SRAM (250 MB)
    - Main memory 
        - DRAM (32 GB)
        - Speed = 10-100
        - Cost = 1000
        - Table of apps with corresponding pages (app 1, page 1)
        - 200 Mhz
        - Hit ratio: % time cache has previously fetched instruction
    - Magnetic Rotating Disk (Disk)
        - Slow speed, but low cost 
        - Speed = 10,000
        - Cost = 1
- We want the speed of microprocessor, but cost of disk
- Microprocessor runs at 1 GHz while main memory runs at 200MHz
    - Microprocessor is only able to fetch instructions every 5 clock cycles, throttling performance
- High hit rate is due to a principle called "locality"
    1. Temporal: if this information was used in the recent past, it will probably be needed in the near future
        - Think for loop 
    2. Spatial: if this information was used at a particular address, addresses close to that address will probably be used

- 3 Main Cache Organizations
    1. Direct Map (sloest, least expensive)
    2. Set Associative (happy medium)
    3. Fully Associative (fastest, most expensive)
